    "\n",
    "-   ****Data****: The foundation of machine learning. Data can be structured (e.g., tables, databases) or unstructured (e.g., text, images).\n",
    "-   ****Observations****: Individual data points or instances in the dataset. In a tabular dataset, observations are the rows that represent different examples.\n",
    "-   ****Features****: Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data. In a tabular dataset, features are the columns that represent different attributes.\n",
    "-   ****Labels****: The target variable or outcome that the model is trying to predict. This is usually one of the columns in a tabular dataset.\n",
    "-   ****Model****: A mathematical representation of the relationship between features and labels. The model is trained on the data to learn these relationships.\n",
    "-   ****Training****: The process of teaching a machine learning model using a dataset. During training, the model learns to identify patterns in the data.\n",
    "-   ****Testing****: Evaluating the performance of a trained model on a separate dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities."

    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types based on the nature of the learning task:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   ****Supervised Learning****: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each observation has a corresponding label. The goal is to learn a mapping from features to labels. Examples include ****classification**** and ****regression**** tasks.\n",
    "-   ****Unsupervised Learning****: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where the goal is to find patterns or groupings in the data. Examples include ****clustering**** and ****dimensionality reduction**** tasks.\n",
    "-   ****Reinforcement Learning****: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore these concepts in more detail in a bit, but for now, it is important to understand that machine learning relies heavily on data and the relationships between features and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also introduce more advanced concepts in later sessions, as needed."

It includes datasets, preprocessing utilities, and various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.\n",
